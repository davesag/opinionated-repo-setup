An opinionated command line utility to set up GitHub repositories exactly how I like them.

* `develop` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davesag/opinionated-repo-setup.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/davesag/github-label-fixer)
* `master` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/davesag/opinionated-repo-setup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/davesag/github-label-fixer)

## What does it do?

```
npm install -g opinionated-repo-setup
```

then run `repo-setup`, supply your [GitHub personal token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/), ensuring that token gives the rights to edit project labels, create branches, and so forth, then supply your project owner name and the repository name, and it will do a bunch of stuff (_fill in details later_)
